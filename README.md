## An Online Edition of the famed Uxbridge English Dictionary.

Using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, I decided to build an online edition of the Ubxridge English Dictionary, something listeners of BBC Radio 4's [*I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_on_I%27m_Sorry_I_Haven%27t_a_Clue#Uxbridge_English_Dictionary_.28formerly_New_Definitions.29) will be familar with.
